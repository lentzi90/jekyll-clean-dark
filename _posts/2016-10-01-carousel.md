It is now possible to include image carousels in posts!
To accomplish this you have to add images to the front matter like this:

```
images:
  - images/nemo.jpg
  - images/walley.jpg
  - images/web.jpg
```

Then just put this where you want the carousel:
`{% raw %}{% include carousel.html %}{% endraw %}`

{% include carousel.html %}

As you can see, it works best when all images have the same dimensions
